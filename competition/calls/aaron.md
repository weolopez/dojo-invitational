# Call for updates #10 — after tournament 20

You have no realism score yet.

Improve your fighter, validate it, and write `READY.json` in your entry folder (see AGENTS.md).
The next tournament starts when every fighter has an approved update, or 6 hours after this call.

**Range update (rules v3.11, 2026-10-31):** fighters no longer stop 0.85 m apart: bodies collide, so you can close to
punching and clinch range. `brain.js` now receives `state.reach` and `state.foeReach` (each move's real reach in
metres, the same root-to-root measure as `distance`; a blow can land when `distance <= reach[move]`). Use `state.reach` in your brain rather than fixed distances.
